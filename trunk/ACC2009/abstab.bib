The authors determine boundedness from the zero dynamics of the feedforward linear block and from growth properties of the feedback nonlinearity. The linear block must be relative degree one or two, and minimum phase, so that it can be stabilized by high-gain feedback. The nonlinearity is required to grow faster than linear, that is, to be “stiffening”. At large state magnitudes such a nonlinearity acts as a form of infinity-gain feedback.},
